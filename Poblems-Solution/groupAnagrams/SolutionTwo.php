    /**
     * Approach:
     *      * If we changed the problem so that the value of strs[i] will consists of an array of prime numbers instead of a string of lowercase English letters - think of the string as an array of characters -
     *          so the new problem will be like that:
     *          Input: strs = [[2,3,5],[3,5,2],[3,5],[3],[5,3]]
     *          Output: [
     *                      [ [2,3,5], [3,5,2] ],
     *                      [ [3,5], [5,3] ],
     *                      [ [3] ]
     *                  ]
     *      * Nice, now what?
     *      * There is a math fact that the prime factors of a number are unique per that number
     *          this means that no two or more numbers will have the same prime factors,
     *          and due to the fact that the multiplication of any group of numbers in any order will have the same result,
     *          we can conclude that there is a one to one map between any number and its prime factors.
     *      * Nice, now what?
     *      * Are You sure?
     *      * Yeah!
     *      * Ok, now, according to what we have established, for each group of anagrams arrays, the multiplication of the values of each array will be the same
     *           because they are the same numbers but in different order.
     *          ex:
     *                [ 2*3*5 ==  3*5*2 == 30 ],
     *                [ 3*5   ==  5*3   == 15 ],
     *                [ 3     == 3 ]
     *      * Now we can achieve something like that:
     *      *  Anagrams = [
     *              '30'   => [2,3,5], [3,5,2],
     *              '15'   => [3,5], [5,3],
     *              '3'   => [3],
     *          ]
     *      * Now we have one problem which is the overflow problem, as the length of $strs[i] can be 100,
     *          so we can have a value like 2^100. We can easily solve this problem by taking the mod to a large prime number
     *          like (10^9 +7) when multiplying. See The Code.
     *      * Now we have solved the new version of the problem. How to solve the original one?
     *      * You can easily map each character to a prim number.
     *
     *      * Nice, now what?
     *      * Now it is your turn, bye!
     *
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Time analysis:
     *      * without counting the steps the functions like str_split, array_values take!
     *      * The exact number of steps ( âˆ‘ (strs[i].len) where 0 <= i < strs.length-1 )
     *      * The worst number of steps = 100*10^4 = 10^6
     *
     * Collision possibility
     *      * AS I remember, the collision possibility is (1/mod), and we are using mod = 10^9, so it will be 10^(-9)
     *          which is too small and will pass from testcases but generally if it happens will leed to wrong answer.
